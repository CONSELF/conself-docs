# Validation & tutorials

Thanks to CONSELF you can now start your own CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) workstation in just few clicks. CONSELF, in fact, brings you the most innovative feature of cloud computing and opensource software. CONSELF is in fact a web-application which allows to run CFD/FEM simulations directly from your browser. The software used to run the calculations are [OpenFOAM®](https://openfoam.org/) and [CodeAster®](http://www.code-aster.org/). These two tools represent the most advanced software for CAE simulations currently available.
