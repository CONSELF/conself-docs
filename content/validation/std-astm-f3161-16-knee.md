## INTRODUCTION

In this page we will show you how to set up a static structural analysis of metallic orthopaedic total knee femoral components.

The CONSELF application *STANDARD » ASTM F3161-16 – Knee* allows the user to simulate the knee femoral component designs for the prediction of the static implant stresses and strains. This application follows the requirements and considerations of the ASTM F3161-16 standard test method for the calculation of stresses and strains seen on a cemented and cementless total knee femoral component under closing conditions.

The CONSELF application *STANDARD » ASTM F3161-16 – Knee* can be used to establish the worst case within a family of implant sizes in order to provide efficiencies in the amount of physical testing to be conducted.

## TUTORIAL

In order to run the following tutorial, please download the geometry file from here: [Knee Femoral Component - ASTM F3161-16.stp](/files/Knee Femoral Component - ASTM F3161-16.stp) (1.3 MB).

For this tutorial, we are using a geometry file based on the representative knee femoral component model provided by the ASTM Committee F04 on Medical and Surgical Materials and Devices: [link](https://www.astm.org/COMMITTEE/F04.htm).

To start the tutorial, you have to log in to the *CONSELF Platform* and create a new *Case* to be named *“Knee Component Testing”*.

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/01 Case.png" alt="For each Case, you have to prepare 4 steps: Geometry, Mesh, Mech and Results." title="For each Case, you have to prepare 4 steps: Geometry, Mesh, Mech and Results." class="figure-50" >}}

## GEOMETRY

The geometry of the knee femoral component shall be previously prepared (using a CAD modeler software or an online CAD system such as Onshape) as described in ASTM F3161-16:

1. The knee femoral component shall be positioned in 90 degrees of flexion, with the X axis pointing from posterior to anterior direction. 
2. A 7.62 mm diameters circle shall be projected over the apex of the posterior articulating surface of the knee femoral component. The face generated by the intersection of this projected circle with the articulating surface will be subjected to loading. 
3. The knee femoral component shall be cut with a horizontal plane defining a closed perimeter around the anterior flange periphery. This cut represents the level below which the anterior flange surfaces shall be constrained. 

#### FILE DATA

You have to upload the geometry from your computer or directly from your Onshape account, then select the correct unit of measure, in this case *Millimeters*.

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/02 Geometry.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

#### BOUNDARY CREATION

You have to create the boundaries for the uploaded geometry. In this case, there are 6 regions of interest:

* LOAD
* CONSTRAINT
* ANTERIOR NOTCH
* MEDIAL CONDYLE
* LATERAL CONDYLE
* FREE 

The scheme of the boundaries for the geometry used in this tutorial is illustrated in the following image:

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/03 Boundaries scheme.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

For each boundary, you have to:

* Select the surfaces by clicking on them 
* *Create Boundary*
* Assign a name to the boundary 
* *Create*

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/04 Boundary creation.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

After having created all the boundaries, you can click on *Next* to proceed. 

#### DOMAIN

For structural analysis, the simulation type can be *Internal* only. To proceed, you have to click on *Submit*, choose a name for the *Geometry* step and confirm the submission. 

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/05 Geometry submission.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

Now, the geometry is preparing on the cloud. In the meanwhile, you can work on other projects or even shutdown your computer until the geometry is finally prepared. 

## MESH

When the case is ready, you have to reopen it to start the *Mesh* step. 

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/06 Geometry completed.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

#### VOLUME MESH

You have to select the previous *Geometry* step and assign the level of uniformity of the volume mesh. For this case, 75% is a good value. The higher the value, the better the numerical results, but the meshing and calculation time increases. 

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/07 Mesh Volume.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

#### SURFACE REFINEMENT

For each boundary previously defined, you have to assign a uniformity level and a max element size, in accordance with this table. The max element size has to be smaller for smaller or more curved and irregular surfaces, and where high stress and strain gradients are expected. At the same time, the max element size can be bigger if the surface is more regular or flat. As before, the higher the value, the better the numerical results, but the meshing and calculation time increases.

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/08 Mesh Surface.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}


|Boundary|Uniformity Level [%]|Max Element Size [m]|
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
|LOAD|85|0.001|
|CONSTRAINT|85|0.001|
|ANTERIOR NOTCH|85|0.001|
|MEDIAL CONDYLE|85|0.001|
|LATERAL CONDYLE|85|0.001|
|FREE|85|0.001|

To proceed, you have to click on *Submit*, choose a name for the *Mesh* step and confirm the submission.

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/09 Mesh Submission.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

Now, the mesh is preparing on the cloud. In the meanwhile, you can work on other projects or even shutdown your computer until the mesh is finally prepared. 

## MECH

When the case is ready, you have to reopen it to start the *Mech* step, where you have to set up the conditions of the Mechanical Model, the Boundary Conditions and the Simulation settings.

### MECHANICAL MODEL

You have to select the previous *Mesh* step and the Mechanical model, that for this application can be *Isotropic linear elastic* only. Then, you have to insert the Solid properties, these values can be usually obtained from the material certification data.

For this case, we use the cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy CoCrMo with following material properties:

* Density - ρ: 8400 kg/m³
* Poisson coefficient ν: 0.29
* oung Modulus – Y: 230000 MPa 

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/10 Mechanical Model.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

#### BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

For each boundary previously defined, you have to assign a Boundary Condition type and the relative data, in accordance with the following table. 

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/11 Boundary conditions.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

|Boundary|Type|Data|
|--------|----|----|
|LOAD|LOAD - Force|Fx = 1 N; Fy = 0 N; Fz = 0 N|
|CONSTRAINT|CONSTRAINT - Fixed||
|ANTERIOR NOTCH|CONSTRAINT - Free||
|MEDIAL CONDYLE|CONSTRAINT - Free||
|LATERAL CONDYLE|CONSTRAINT - Free||
|FREE|CONSTRAINT - Free||

A load of magnitude F = 1 N along the X-axis in the anterior direction was applied over the previously defined circular face.

#### SIMULATION SETTINGS

You have to select the iterations number and the output frequency to save the solutions results. For a simple geometry like the one analyzed in this case, 1 iteration is a good value. Another parameter you have to choose is the number of cores to be used during the computation. This choice affects the credits used in the current simulation. To proceed, you have to click on *Submit*, choose a name for the *Mech* step and confirm the submission. 

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/12 Simulation Settings.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

Now, the simulation is running on the cloud. In the meanwhile, you can work on other projects or even shutdown your computer until the simulation is completed.

## RESULTS

When the case is ready, you have to reopen it to start the *Results* step.

#### CHECK RESULTS VALIDITY

First you have to check the residuals history of your simulation. If the residuals converge to very low values, the simulation ran correctly. If the residuals are high, you have to change the simulation settings or run more Iterations.

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/13 Results residuals.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

#### RESULTS VISUALIZATION

Now, you can finally visualize your results at the last Iteration. If you want, you can see your results directly on CONSELF or download them.

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/14 Results visualization.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

The measure of interest for this case are the strain and von Mises stress at the Anterior Notch and the Medial and Lateral Condyles.

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/15 Results Anterior Notch.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

{{< figure src="/images/std-astm-f3161-16-knee/16 Results condyles.png" alt="" title="" class="figure-50" >}}

Excessive erroneous stress generated close the constrained region are due to the influence of rigid fixation.
