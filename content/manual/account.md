## SUBSCRIPTION

CONSELF it is a **pay-per-use CFD** application available via browser. In order to enjoy this service, you must **activate** one of the [available plans](https://conself.com/product/subscriptions/).

{{< figure src="/images/pricing.png" alt="Subscription plans" title="Subscription plans" class="figure-50" >}}

The plans currently available are mainly two:

- **FREELANCE** and **ENTERPRISE**: these two plans can be activated automatically. They both give access to the complete set of commercial features present in the application and their difference regards the number of credits given every month to the user: 250 for the FREELANCE and 1500 for the ENTERPRISE.

#### CREDITS

With the subscription the user obtains a certain number of credits. Since each credit represents 1 CPU/hour of usage of CONSELF hardware resources, it is not possible to use the web application without a subscription activated. The credits calculation only starts when the process is actually submitted and in *RUNNING* status - so the whole settings phase has absolutely no influence on the amount of credits used.

In case the process returns an ERROR message, the credits used are not charged to the user balance.
