      <description>SUBSCRIPTION CONSELF it is a pay-per-use CFD application available via browser. In order to enjoy this service, you must activate one of the available plans.
 Subscription plans   The plans currently abailable are mainly three:
 WELCOME: free plan, every user can activate. No credit card data required. With a free plan you can access up to 100 credits every month and 10GB of cloud storage. The main limitation regards the lack of commercial features, which are frozen for the current plan.</description>

      <title>Simulation Process</title>

      <description>INTRODUCTION Using CONSELF means entering a new mindset, a new philosophy of simulating. Therefore, in order to be able to read and understand the following tutorials, bear in mind the following key definitions:
Simulation: a mathematical procedure that allows to reproduce in a virtual environment - software - a physical behavior. Compared to laboratory tests, it is a quicker and cheaper process. Ultimately, simulations help engineers validate the hypothesis behind every design phase.</description>

      <description>The geometry step represents the phase in which the user defines the main geometrical characteristics of the case. The user is required to draw a complete geometry using a CAD software. The geometry file must be loaded in terms of fluid volume in case of a CFD analysis and solid volume in case of MECH analysis. Some geometry files are available to be freely downloaded and used in our web application in this page.</description>

      <description>Mesh is the STEP required in order to define the mesh.
VOLUME MESH In this section the user is asked to define the mesh algorithm and the basic mesh feature.
 Meshing algorithm: drop down list from which the user has to select the meshing algorithm (see pictures below).
 Hexahedral: by using this algorithm, a fully cartesian grid is obtained. Depending on the mesh dimension specifications on the boundaries, local grid refinements are applied to meet the resolution constraints.</description>

      <description>The CFD step represents the widest part of the whole simulation settings. The parameters present in the current step may vary according to the application chosen.
FLUID MODELS The first section is about defining the fluid models, turbulence and density in particular.
 Flow type: drop down list from which the user has to select the flow type
 Incompressible: to simulate incompressible fluids like water, oil or air at low velocity.</description>

      <description>CONSELF offers a web based application to postprocess results. Have a look at the following video to check out the most important features of this web application.
   Beside this tool, there are two more functionalities, highlighted in the picture: residual plot and results download. The first one displays the residuals of pressure and velocity fields obtained during the calculation, the latter instead allows to download the results in your local machine.</description>
