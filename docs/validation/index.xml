      <description>INTRODUCTION In this page will be presented how to setup a wind tunnel virtual test on a car model. This is a typical application where the user wants to simulate a uniform velocity profile entering the tunnel from the inlet that reaches the vehicle. It is typically used to evaluate vehicle performances as aerodynamics coefficients. In this case, in order to explain how realistic simulations are carried out, wind tunnel floor will be modeled as a moving wall, with a translational velocity equal to the flow one.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION In this page will be presented how to setup a car park smoke ventilation simulation. The current case represent a general HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning). Closed car parks in fact suffer of at least two major issue every designer has to take into consideration: production of CO by cars smoke exhausts and high fire risk compared to many surrounding areas. For these reasons, it is common habit to use a ventilation system with the dual purpose: maintaining low level of CO concentrations in standard conditions and guarantee a smoke free way out in a fire scenario.</description>
