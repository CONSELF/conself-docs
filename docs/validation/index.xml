      <description>INTRODUCTION In this page we will show you how to set up a static structural analysis of non-modular metallic orthopedic hip femoral stems.
The CONSELF application STANDARD » ASTM F2996-13 – Hip allows the user to simulate the hip stem designs for the prediction of the static implant stresses and strains. This application follows the requirements and considerations of the ASTM F2996-13 standard practice for the calculation of stresses and strains seen on a femoral hip stem when loaded in a manner described in the ISO 7206-4 (2010) standard.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION In this page will be presented how to setup a wind tunnel virtual test on a car model. This is a typical application where the user wants to simulate a uniform velocity profile entering the tunnel from the inlet that reaches the vehicle. It is typically used to evaluate vehicle performances as aerodynamics coefficients. In this case, in order to explain how realistic simulations are carried out, wind tunnel floor will be modeled as a moving wall, with a translational velocity equal to the flow one.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION In this page will be presented how to setup a car park smoke ventilation simulation. The current case represent a general HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning). Closed car parks in fact suffer of at least two major issue every designer has to take into consideration: production of CO by cars smoke exhausts and high fire risk compared to many surrounding areas. For these reasons, it is common habit to use a ventilation system with the dual purpose: maintaining low level of CO concentrations in standard conditions and guarantee a smoke free way out in a fire scenario.</description>
