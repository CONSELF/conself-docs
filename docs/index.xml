      <description>The generation of a CAD file is one of the most important parts of any CFD simulation. CONSELF can handle multiple geometry types in order to help the user during his task. At the same time, it is recommendable to follow some basics tricks in order to be confident about the final result of the simulation and avoid geometry errors and mesh inconsistencies.
Create fluid volumes In order to run a CFD simulation you have to generate the volume of fluid.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION Using CONSELF means entering a new mindset, a new philosophy of simulating. Therefore, in order to be able to read and understand the following tutorials, bear in mind the following key definitions:
Simulation: a mathematical procedure that allows to reproduce in a virtual environment - software - a physical behavior. Compared to laboratory tests, it is a quicker and cheaper process. Ultimately, simulations help engineers validate the hypothesis behind every design phase.</description>

      <title>Common Errors</title>

      <description>After each STEPS has been performed, it is possible to check its results by clicking on the steps summary button. This will report a summary table where RED items are problematic steps. For each problem an error message, with a brief description and suggested action is reported. For the sake of clarity, we report a more detailed description of the problem and the suggested solution to make even easier to our customers the web-application.</description>

      <description>The geometry step represents the phase in which the user defines the main geometrical characteristics of the case. The user is required to draw a complete geometry using a CAD software - see External Link to find free CAD softwares available on the internet that can be used with CONSELF CFD on Cloud. In order to get more information about the generation of CAD files, see this page.
CONSELF can handle multiple unit systems and, furthermore, the user interface has the capability to generate a wind-tunnel geometry around the geometry, in order to speed up the setup process.</description>

      <description>Mesh is the STEP required in order to define the mesh.
Volume mesh In this section the user is asked to define the mesh algorithm and the basic mesh feature.
 Meshing algorithm: drop down list from which the user has to select the meshing algorithm (see pictures below).
 Hexahedral: by using this algorithm, a fully cartesian grid is obtained. Depending on the mesh dimension specifications on the boundaries, local grid refinements are applied to meet the resolution constraints.</description>

      <description>The CFD step represents the widest part of the whole simulation settings. The parameters present in the current step may vary according to the application chosen.
Fluid Models The first section is about defining the fluid models, turbulence and density in particular.
 Flow type: drop down list from which the user has to select the flow type
 Incompressible: to simulate incompressible fluids like water, oil or air at low velocity.</description>

      <description>CONSELF offers a web based application to postprocess results. Have a look at the following video to check out the most important features of this web application.
   Beside this tool, there are two more functionalities, highlighted in the picture: residual plot and results download. The first one displays the residuals of pressure and velocity fields obtained during the calculation, the latter instead allows to download the results in your local machine.</description>
